- 👋 Hi, I’m @Lewisthecolonist
- 👀 I’m interested in Web3 and deep learning AI
- 🌱 I’m currently learning different crypto and financial based libraries
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my crypto bot I am currently working on
- 📫 How to reach me: message the number 470-266-6111
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him
- ⚡ Fun fact: My current bot currently only has market making based infastructure, but I plan on making the bot use multiple different forms bot based income. I'm currently around 2% daily return rate.
- 👋 Help wanted: I'm looking to collaborate with someone who has a good grasp on bot based sniping, HFT, abritrage and any other bot based techniques. For now lets keep it crypto only.
- 👀 Quick mention: There wil hopefully be multiple collaborators of different skills and among all colaborators and among these colaborators the current plan is to clone the bot and split the profits between collaborators. If these seems unfair in any way it can be negotiated.
- WARNING: If you decide to become a collaborator you will not have acess to the full code only what they came here for and will be required to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA). I will sign an agreement as well to clone this bot and run a cloud based server for the clone out of my pocket. This is to not make one collaborater have the abilty to clone as many as he likes and take advantage of the team. Also when creating your part MAKE SURE to create a config file and make sure parameters are specific so to remove the chance of multiple parameters being named the same. Lastly, each collaborator will be limited to a specific repository and use the project platform to stay updated and to update on your progress and bugs as someone may have an idea(keep leaked code to the bare minimium to reduce risk). Keep frequent status updates.
